# openssl-samples
OpenSSL is the most widely used open source cryptographic library in the world. However, one of this library's major flaw is that it's not well documented. To address this, this project aims to make available a complete set of samples for the OpenSSL library.

This project will provide examples on how to use the Non-EVP (low-level) and EVP (high-level) API of OpenSSL.
